# Description

An app to connect you with small businesses in your local area!  

Business owners can add their business to the database, and users can search their surrounding area for different types of local shops.  Nextdoor Neighbor will display restaurants, boutiques, grocery stores and beauty shops.  Users can sort the stores by type and view them on a map.  The goal is to help people find and share small businesses with each other in a pleasing and easy to use format.  

# Upgrades Pending

We would like to add a review function so users can share their experiences with other users.  Support for more types of stores could be added.  

# Collaborators
